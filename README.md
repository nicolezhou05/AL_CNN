# Lab02: Well Al B. Sorted

## TNPG: CNN (Nada Hameed + Ray, Nicole Zhou + Duck, Corina Chen + Binktop)

### AlTester
Default constructor populates the array with 23 random ints. It also contains a method to check if an array is sorted or not (returns true if the array is sorted, false otherwise).

### OrderedArrayList
- `toString` : displays information in a specific way
- `remove` : using the given index, it removes the element of that index in the array
- `size` : returns the length of the array that displays the meaningful data
- `get` : returns the value of the element at the given index in the array
- `addLinear` : goes through each element of the array one by one to add a new value that will continue to maintain the invariant that its elements are sorted.
- `addBinary` : adds a new value to the array that will continue to maintain the invariant that its elements are sorted without going through each and every single element.
