DISCOS:
- ArrayList does not have a 'length' method but does have a 'size' method
- ArrayList's '.get' method finds the item at the index you're searching for
- Integer converts a primitive to an object and vice versa

QCCS:
- in addLinear, we can either return nothing (return;) or create a boolean inserted, and continue the loop until the newVal has been inserted
  -> return; is more efficient so that's what we employed
